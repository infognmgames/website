                <p>This Privacy Policy is designed to provide clarity about the personal information and data GNM Game Studios and/or any of its agents, consultants, employees, officers and directors collect, how it is collected, why it is being processed, how and where it is used, how long it is being retained, and whether it is being shared with any other parties. By installing and playing a game or any other application provided by GNM Game Studios on the Apple App Store, Google Play App Store, you give your explicit and informed consent to the processing of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</p>

It can be anything from a name, a home address, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information, or a computer's IP address."</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>GNM Game Studios collects data from you, through your interactions with our games. GNM Game Studios facilitates third-party advertisement, tracking and analytics services and these services also collect both non-personal and personal data.</p>

                <p>First type of data we collect is the Process Data acquired through your direct interaction with our game. This data is related solely to your progress at our games and you cannot be personally identified through this type of data. Thus, this type of data is non-personal. Non-personal information includes technical information, behavioural data and statistical data. Also, we do not ask of you to submit any personal information at any of our games as they do not require registration. Third-party services might also collect non-personal information. Non-personal Information collected by third-parties may include the following technical information: type of operation system (e.g. Android, iOS, etc.), type of browser (e.g. Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.), screen resolution (e.g. 800×600, 1024×768, etc.), language (e.g. English), device type (e.g. Galaxy, HTC, iPhone, etc.), geo-location – only general location may be collected.</p>

                <p>However, third-party advertisement, tracking and analytics services that we use, and Google, if you use your Google accounts to play one of our games, may have access to personal information such as your device identifier, MAC address, IMEI, location (specific location where a given language is spoken), geo-location information, and IP address for the purpose of providing their services under their respective privacy policies. GNM Game Studios does not have control over these third parties and has access, as provided by these services, to the collective, anonymous data.</p>

                <h2>How Do We Collect Information</h2>
